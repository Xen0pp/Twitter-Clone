Twitter Clone - Built with HTML & Tailwind CSS
Welcome to the Twitter Clone project — a modern, responsive social media interface inspired by Twitter (now X), designed from the ground up using HTML5 and Tailwind CSS.

This project is a perfect playground to deepen your front-end development skills by recreating a familiar social platform interface with elegant design, utility-first CSS, and a mobile-friendly layout.

Project Overview
Social media platforms shape how we connect and communicate, and Twitter’s clean UI is legendary for its simplicity and intuitive user experience. This project represents a live, static clone that replicates parts of the Twitter feed interface, including:

Fixed sidebar navigation with icons and labels

Sticky top navigation with "For You" and "Following" tabs

User profile card & post input box

Dynamic post listings with avatars, content, and interaction icons

Search panel and trending topics section

Responsive behavior for different screen sizes

Utilizing Tailwind CSS’s flexibility, this clone achieves an impressive level of detail and polish with minimal CSS bloat, emphasizing customizability, reusability, and scalable design principles.

Technologies Used
HTML5: Semantic markup for structure and accessibility

Tailwind CSS (v4.x): Utility-first CSS framework powering styling and layout

Google Material Symbols: For crisp and consistent iconography

Responsive Design: Flexbox & custom breakpoints for adaptability across devices

Key Features
Responsive Sidebar Navigation: Collapsible and icon-based menus that gracefully adjust on smaller screens

Sticky Headers & Sections: Persistent navigation for smooth user experience on scrolling

Post Interaction UI: Like, comment, share buttons with hover effects and counters for realistic look

Search & Who to Follow Widgets: Modular widgets inspired by Twitter’s sidebar content

Typography & Color Palette: Dark theme with clear contrast and crisp fonts for readability

Mobile-first Approach: Ensures usability from phones to widescreens

Installation & Setup
Get the project up and running locally with these simple steps:

Clone the repository:

bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/twitter-clone.git
cd twitter-clone
Tailwind CSS Setup:

Since this is a static site using compiled Tailwind CSS, ensure you have the following:

Node.js and npm installed

Tailwind CLI or PostCSS configured

Install dependencies (if using Tailwind CLI):

bash
npm install -D tailwindcss postcss autoprefixer
Build Tailwind CSS:

(To be run whenever you update Tailwind classes in your HTML or CSS)

bash
npx tailwindcss -i ./src/input.css -o ./css/output.css --watch
Open index.html in your browser to view the working clone.
